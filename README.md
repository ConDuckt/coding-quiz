Bootcamp Challenge 04: JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Description

This is the fourth project from my bootcamp, which is supposed to be an interactive quiz using JS to append elements and keep track of scoring / time.

Unfortunately, I ran into life issues that disrupted my week, but I did get as far as designing the framework for a question with selectable answers to populate, as well as increase the score and reduce the time as required.

My takeaway from this one is learning how to effectively apply pseudocode for the first time.
